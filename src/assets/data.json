When the the user types the given keys, they will hear the sound from the drums as displayed in the page. This is a fun page that I developed in 2020 while studying independently, and was one of my first works. Developing this page got me even more interested coding, and more than anything, helped me to get into JavaScript. There is HTML, CSS and JavaScript."

The site contains the most important things that are the Menu, Contact information and Location. I only used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript."

The six team members divided the work to   make this amazing page that enables users to type a musician's name and then several songs from that artist appear. Once a song is selected, the lyrics appear. Alternatively, a user can type the song title and the lyrics will show up. This site is good for singers who want to reproduce music by other artists, or for music enthusiasts who want to learn their favourite songs. I was responsible for the front-end, so I used flexbox in order to make it functional and responsive, too. We used two different APIs (iTunes and lyrics.ovh), HTML, CSS and JavaScript."

Users can post any information, news, or anything about the IT world. A personal challenge for me was using Handlebars. I find it a little bit complicated having to use Handlebars with MySQL, but I managed to make it work.
